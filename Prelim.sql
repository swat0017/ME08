SUMMARY OF FIRE AND SPECIES ANALYSIS						
• This dataset presents a preliminary analysis of species listed under national environmental law, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, which occur in the areas affected by fires in southern and eastern Australia between 1 August 2019 and 13 January 2020.						
• The analysis was undertaken by the Australian Government Department of the Environment and Energy on 14 January 2020.						
• The analysis intersects spatial data on the extent of the fires to date collated from the state fire agencies with modelled distributions of listed species prepared by the Department. It includes listed threatened species and migratory species.						
• The analysis includes covers bioregions that have been impacted by fires from south-west Western Australia, southern South Australia, Victoria, southern and eastern New South Wales, south-eastern Queensland and Tasmania. This analysis area may be refined in future versions.						
• The species distributions are produced by spatial ecologists in the Department using modelling software and environmental data to map the known and predicted areas of occurrence of listed species, including areas of potential habitat. Such modelling may overestimate the actual range which species occupy, so the data are indicative only.						
• Some species may have been included in the dataset that occur near, but not in, the areas affected by the fires.						
• Others, such as the Western Ground Parrot Pezoporus flaviventris, may have a larger portion of their actual range affected by fires than this preliminary analysis indicates.						
• The list will be refined with further investigation and finer scale data.						
WHAT IS IN THE RESULTS DATASET						
The dataset includes the following columns:						
• Scientific Name is the formal name for the species accepted by the Australian Faunal Directory or Council of Heads of Australasian Herbaria.  The hyperlink included in this column is to the Department of the Environment and Energy’s Species Profile and Threats (SPRAT) database, where a distribution map, conservation advice and/or recovery plans for each species can be viewed.						
• Common Name is the plain language name(s) used for the species.						
• Percentage of the species modelled likely and known distribution within fire affected areas is the spatial overlap between the species’ distribution and the mapped extent of the fires.						
• Type group species into: Plants, Mammals, Birds, Fish, Reptiles, Frogs, Spiders and Insects						
• EPBC Act listed Threatened Status is the category within the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 Threatened Species list that the species is listed in. Categories reflect the risk of extinction, with Critically Endangered species being at greatest risk, then Endangered and Vulnerable species. Criteria for listing in each of these categories are set out in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Regulations 2000 and follow the Global IUCN Red List categories and criteria.						
• EPBC Act listed Migratory Status indicates species which move outside of Australian and are subject to international migratory species conservation agreements. Note that some species are listed as threatened and migratory.						
• Range states and territories are the states and territories that the species may occur in.						
PRELIMINARY RESULTS						
The results are indicative only, and are just the first step in understanding the potential impacts of the bushfires. Preliminary results indicate that:						
• 49 listed threatened species have more than 80% of their modelled likely or known distribution within the fire extent;						
• a further 65 listed threatened species have more than 50%, but less than 80%, of their modelled likely or known distribution within the fire extent;						
• a further 77 listed threatened species have more than 30%, but less than 50%, of their modelled likely or known distribution within the fire extent; and						
• a further 136 listed threatened species and 4 listed migratory species have more than 10%, but less than 30%, of their modelled likely or known distribution within the fire extent.						
• Please note: 5 species which are listed as migratory (of which 1 is also listed as threatened) have more than 10%, but less than 30%, of their modelled likely or known distribution in Australia within the fire extent. Their range outside of Australia has not been included in this analysis.						
WHAT THIS ANALYSIS DOESN’T TELL US						
• The vulnerability of each species to fire and the on-ground pattern and intensity of fire have not been incorporated into this analysis. Some species are more tolerant to fire than others or have a greater capacity to recover from fire. The fires will not have impacted all areas within the mapped extent equally. For example, the Wollemi Pine Wollemia nobilis occurs within the extent of the fires and appears in the dataset but the Department has received reports that the pines were successfully protected from fire. Some species which were not in the path of the fires have been removed from the results, based on advice from state agencies. Further updates will be made to incorporate local and expert knowledge.						
• Species which are not listed under the EPBC Act have not been included in this analysis. Many species not currently listed under national environmental law will have had much of their range affected by the fires and, in some cases, that impact may mean that these species have become threatened. The Department will be considering assessments of these species in the near future.						
• In many cases our knowledge about species distributions, fire severity, other threats, and impact on plants and animals is incomplete, and requires updating to inform decisions.						
NEXT STEPS						
• Guided by the Wildlife and Threatened Species Bushfire Recovery Expert Panel, the Department of the Environment and Energy is working with state and territory governments and scientific experts to improve the mapping and determine the likely response of these and other species to fire, and to understand critical knowledge gaps.						
• Once it is safe to enter fire-affected areas, authorities will be able to more accurately assess the severity of the fires and the impacts on individual species. Future updates of this dataset will incorporate that information.						
• Fires are continuing to burn in parts of Australia and the fire extent mapping will be continue to be updated. New information will feed into future updates.  						
• Further information on other natural assets (including threatened ecological communities, heritage places and Ramsar wetlands) will be published in the future.						
NOTE ON KOALAS						
• The population of Koalas in Queensland, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory is listed as Vulnerable under national environment law. Koalas also occur in South Australia and Victoria but they are not part of the listed population. The analysis only includes the listed population. The analysis shows that 12 per cent of the modelled likely or known distribution of the listed population of the Koala is within the fire extent.
